# Course Overview

This course provides foundational skills in data science and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). It is divided into two main sections: 

1) data processing, visualization, and R programming using the `tidyverse`, and 

2) an introduction to GIS using ESRI's ArcPro software.

## Course Goals

### Data Wrangling and Visualization in R

The goal of this section is to give students a broad understanding of data processing, visualization, in the R programming environment. Students will investigate a range of features in the `tidyverse` package over the course in order to assemble a toolkit for effective data wrangling and visualization.

### Introduction to GIS using ArcPro

This section is designed to provide students with a practical introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using ESRIâ€™s ArcPro software. The section will focus on building foundational GIS skills and understanding its practical applications. Each week will introduce new concepts and will cover specific ArcPro tools to enhance hands-on learning.

## Course Structure

* **Meeting Time**: 4 hours of combined lecture and lab per week.

Each class will be roughly divided into two sections: 

1) Data wrangling, visualization, and programming, and 

2) Building GIS skills using ArcPro. 

A short lecture for each section will introduce the week's concepts, and then students will complete in-class exercises.

## Evaluation

Your final grade will be based on the following components:

* **Class Participation**: 20%
* **Project 1: R & Data Visualization**: 40%
    * Create an **R Markdown or Quarto document** and serve it as a standalone website (using GitHub pages) showing data wrangling and visualization skills. You can provide your own data from your thesis project or I can help you find a dataset (likely NCRMP related).
* **Project 2: GIS Mapping**: 40%
    * Create **GIS map(s) in ArcGIS Pro** visualizing your data. Again, you can use your own data or NCRMP-related data.
